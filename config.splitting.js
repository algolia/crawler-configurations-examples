// This config can split long content into more than 1 record per resource, by:
//
// 1. extracting the text from a given list of elements; (see TEXT_ELEMENTS)
// 2. and, if needed, splitting the textual content of each matching element
//    into more than one record, depending on the maximum record size allowed
//    by your Algolia plan. (see the `maxRecordBytes` property)
//
// In order to make sure that every word of that content can be used to match
// the page, the splitting will happen between words, and whitespace (including
// line breaks) will be de-duplicated into single spaces.
//
// Feel free to change the page metadata (`baseRecord`) that will be included in
// all resulting records, based on your needs.
